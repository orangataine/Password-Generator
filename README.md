**Password Generator**:

Simple password generator built to help users create random passwords. 

- This is a project I did as part of the Scrimba javascript module.
- I did some reading on Math.random() and understand it's a relatively weak algorithm that is easily exploitable.
- My next step is to research and implement complex algorithms to generate more random passwords.
-  "The Web Crypto API provides the crypto.getRandomValues() method, which generates strong, cryptographically secure random values. This function fills a typed array (e.g.,                   Uint8Array) with cryptographically strong random values, making it suitable for security-sensitive applications like password generation."
- Then add password features, allowing users to increment the password length, pick their symbols, clear fields etc. âœ…
